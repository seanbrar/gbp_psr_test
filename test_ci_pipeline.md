# CI Pipeline Test

This file is being used to test the CI pipeline with multiple commit types.

## Test Plan

We need to create commits for:
- features (Added section)
- bug fixes (Fixed section) 
- performance improvements (Changed section)
- documentation (Changed section)

Each type will have multiple commits with different scopes to test grouping and alphabetization.

## Features Added

- Core functionality for testing
- Multiple scope testing
- API endpoint for user authentication
- Database connection pooling
- WebSocket support for real-time updates

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed memory leak in connection pool
- Resolved authentication token validation issue
- Fixed WebSocket connection timeout handling
- Fixed race condition in API response handling

## Performance Improvements

- Optimized database query performance
- Reduced API response time by 40%
- Improved WebSocket message processing speed
