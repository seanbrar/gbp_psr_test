# CI Pipeline Test

This file is being used to test the CI pipeline with multiple commit types.

## Test Plan

We need to create commits for:
- features (Added section)
- bug fixes (Fixed section) 
- performance improvements (Changed section)
- documentation (Changed section)

Each type will have multiple commits with different scopes to test grouping and alphabetization.

## Features Added

- Core functionality for testing
- Multiple scope testing
